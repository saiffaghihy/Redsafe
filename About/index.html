      <h1>About RedSafe</h1>
      <p>RedSafe started with a question, why isn’t anyone talking about this?</p>
      <p>Why is it so normal for teens at our school to be surrounded by drugs and alcohol, to feel pressured, to suffer quietly, or to pretend it is not a big deal?</p>
      <p>We are students who decided to do something about it.</p>
      <p>RedSafe is a student-led campaign based at Redwood High School. It was created out of urgency, out of care, and out of a shared belief that the culture surrounding teen drug and alcohol use in our community needs to change. This campaign was not built for attention or a grade. It was built because we have seen the consequences of silence and we are not okay with how accepted those consequences have become.</p>
      <p>We want to be part of the change we wish we saw. We want to contribute something real to our school and community. We want students to feel safe, heard, and supported. We want to challenge what has been overlooked, and replace avoidance with action. That is why RedSafe exists.</p>
      <p>What are we? We are a student-led awareness and prevention campaign, committed to reducing drug and alcohol abuse among teens in Marin County, with a focus on Redwood High School. We do this by combining storytelling, education, peer leadership, and access to real support. We are not professionals, but we are the people living in this reality every day, and that gives us something important to say.</p>

      <h2>We work toward change in four key ways:</h2>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Spreading Awareness</h3>
        <p>Our website and platform break down the root causes and long-term effects of substance abuse. We share local data, explore the specific pressures teens in Marin face, and present this issue in a way that is honest, relatable, and research-based. We want students to not only understand the risks, but also understand that they are not alone.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Amplifying Voices</h3>
        <p>Through our podcast, Redwood Recovery, we sit down with people who have experienced the issue up close. These are recovering addicts, current users, classmates, family members, and professionals who work to help others heal. These conversations are raw and powerful. They open the door for empathy and reflection, and they show how complex and human this issue really is.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Providing Help</h3>
        <p>We are actively collecting and sharing resources for anyone in our school or community who needs help. That includes access to mental health support, contact info for school counselors and community programs, anonymous feedback forms, and crisis hotlines. Our goal is to make getting help feel easier, more comfortable, and less overwhelming.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pillar">
        <h3>Taking Action on Campus</h3>
        <p>We are not just online. We are present at school, working with our Social Issues class, counselors, and other students to create real opportunities for growth and conversation. We are planning fundraisers to support addiction recovery programs, designing workshops and peer-led discussions, and building a space where students can talk without judgment. Everything we do is built around the idea that students have the power to shift the culture from inside the system.</p>
