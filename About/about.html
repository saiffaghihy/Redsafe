      <h2>Who We Are and Why We Care</h2>
      <p>RedSafe was born out of a real need. We’re not outsiders to the issue—we’re students who live it, see it, and understand how serious it’s become. In Marin County, teen drug and alcohol abuse isn’t just a quiet problem—it’s a dangerously normalized part of the high school experience. That’s not okay, and that’s exactly why we created this site.</p>
      <p>We started with one goal: to make people care. But we knew that to do that, we had to go beyond statistics—we had to bring real voices, real solutions, and real support to the table. We had to make this something that students, parents, and educators couldn’t ignore.</p>
      <p>This isn’t about shaming anyone. It’s about breaking cycles. It’s about awareness, recovery, prevention, and empathy. Everything on this site—from the stories we share to the resources we provide—was carefully chosen to reflect the heart of this campaign: students who are tired of seeing their peers silently suffer.</p>
      <p>We are Jimmy Centeno and Saif Faghihy. We’re part of Redwood High School, and we believe that change doesn’t happen from the top down. It happens from within the community. This is our effort to change the narrative. To start conversations. To give people the tools they need. And to let every teen in Marin know that they’re not alone—and they never have to be.</p>
      <p>RedSafe is more than a site. It’s a movement. And you’re now part of it.</p>
