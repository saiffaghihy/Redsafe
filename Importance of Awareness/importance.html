      <h1>Importance of Awareness</h1>
      <p>Awareness is where change begins. Without it, nothing gets questioned, nothing gets fixed, and the cycle continues. When it comes to drug and alcohol abuse in high school, especially in a place like Marin, the biggest danger is how invisible the problem can feel. People don’t talk about it, they look the other way, or they assume it only affects “certain kids.” But the truth is, this issue is closer than most people realize, and until we start talking about it openly, it will keep spreading.</p>
      <p>Raising awareness means putting the truth out there. It means helping students, parents, and the entire school community understand what addiction really is, how it starts, and why it’s so dangerous. Most importantly, it helps people see that they are not alone. Struggling with substance use or watching someone else go through it can feel isolating. But awareness reminds us that this is a shared problem, and that there are people who care, people who want to help, and people who are willing to speak up.</p>
      <p>In class, we learned how awareness affects behavior. If someone doesn’t know the effects of substances on the teenage brain, they are more likely to try it. If they think everyone else is doing it, they’re more likely to give in to peer pressure. Awareness breaks that illusion. It replaces assumptions with facts, and silence with conversation. That shift can be the difference between prevention and regret.</p>
      <p>Part of raising awareness is understanding how the brain works. Teenagers are still developing their prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for planning, decision-making, and understanding consequences. That’s why teens are more likely to take risks without realizing the long-term cost. When we raise awareness, we teach students about this biology. We show them how dopamine affects their motivation, how addiction forms, and how stress and trauma can lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms. That knowledge gives people the power to make better choices.</p>
      <p>Awareness also helps reduce shame. Too many students are afraid to admit when they’re struggling. They think it makes them weak, broken, or “bad.” But when awareness is present, the conversation shifts. Addiction is not a failure, it’s a health issue. Mental health challenges are not something to hide, they’re something to address. When people hear stories, see the facts, and learn the signs, they begin to understand that struggling is human, and asking for help is strength.</p>
      <p>At Redwood, creating awareness is how we start to shift the culture. Whether it’s through our podcast, our campaign materials, class discussions, or the work students are doing in projects like this, every effort counts. The more we talk about it, the more we open space for honesty, accountability, and support. We stop ignoring the problem and start facing it together.</p>
      <p>Awareness also protects those who might not even know they’re at risk. It gives students the information they need before they’re in a high-pressure moment. It prepares them to say no, to walk away, or to reach out to someone else. The more people know, the more they can do, whether for themselves or someone they care about.</p>
      <p>Finally, awareness is what creates action. You can’t solve a problem you don’t understand. By shining a light on substance use in Marin, we are not just naming the issue, we are challenging our community to respond. We are asking Redwood to do better, to listen more, and to stand up for students who are silently struggling.</p>
      <p>This campaign starts with awareness, but it doesn’t end there. Awareness is the first step toward prevention, support, recovery, and change.</p>
