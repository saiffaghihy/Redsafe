      <h1>Marin’s Issue</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="marin-section">
      <p>Drug and alcohol abuse refers to the repeated use of substances like alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, prescription pills, and even stronger drugs such as Xanax or fentanyl, in ways that harm the brain, body, and future. What makes this issue even more serious in high school is how early it begins. In Marin County, students are being introduced to substances as early as middle school, often without understanding the long-term risks. Many start casually, out of curiosity, peer pressure, stress, or a desire to escape difficult emotions. What begins as “just once” can quickly become a routine, a habit, or a coping mechanism that’s hard to break.</p>

      <p>At this age, the teenage brain is still developing. The part of the brain that controls decision-making and impulse control, the prefrontal cortex, is not fully formed until your mid-twenties. That means teens are more likely to take risks, follow the crowd, and underestimate the consequences of their actions. Substances hijack that process. They rewire the brain’s reward system, reducing natural motivation and increasing the need for stimulation just to feel okay. That’s how addiction begins, quietly, slowly, and often without the person realizing it.</p>

      <p>This isn’t about just getting “in trouble.” This is about what happens next. Students who use substances are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, memory problems, poor academic performance, and damaged relationships. Many students report feeling trapped in cycles of guilt, secrecy, and shame. Some reach a point where they can’t sleep, can’t concentrate, and can’t imagine functioning without a substance. That is what addiction looks like, and it is much closer than people think.</p>

      <p>It’s also important to understand that this issue doesn’t look the same for everyone. For some, it’s drinking on weekends. For others, it’s vaping between classes or popping pills to numb emotional pain. Some teens use substances to feel confident or included. Others use them to disconnect from trauma, anxiety, or depression. The reasons are personal, but the impact is deeply harmful no matter what brings someone there.</p>

      <p>Social media plays a huge role in how this issue spreads. Platforms like Snapchat and Instagram often glamorize substance use, making it look fun, normal, or even trendy. What students don’t see are the hospital visits, the panic attacks, the mental health crashes, and the long-term brain damage. What starts as a way to cope or feel accepted can quickly turn into a pattern of self-destruction. And because the culture around these substances often includes silence, shame, and fear, most students don’t ask for help until things have already gotten really bad.</p>

      <p>One of the scariest parts is how accessible everything is. Vapes are sold through social media and passed around like pencils. Pills are stolen from home medicine cabinets or bought online with little knowledge of what’s actually in them. Some drugs are laced with fentanyl without the user knowing, which can be fatal even in small amounts. What feels like a safe experiment to a student can turn into an emergency overnight.</p>

      <p>This issue also hides in plain sight. Students who are high-achieving, well-liked, or heavily involved in school activities can still be struggling. Addiction doesn’t have a “look.” It doesn’t always come with failing grades or visible breakdowns. Sometimes the person who seems like they have it all together is the one silently suffering the most. That’s why awareness and education are so important, because this issue touches all types of students, not just the ones who “seem” at risk.</p>

      <p>Finally, the long-term consequences are not just about health or school. Substance abuse during adolescence can seriously disrupt brain development, alter personality, and reduce future opportunities. It can damage college chances, harm family relationships, and lead to lifelong struggles with addiction. The earlier it starts, the harder it is to stop, and the more it takes from a person’s future.</p>

      <p>This is not just a teenage phase. It is a mental health crisis hiding under the surface of high school life. And unless we confront it with honesty, support, and real solutions, it will continue to harm more students in silence.</p>
