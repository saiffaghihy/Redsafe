      <h1>Causes</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="causes-section">
      <p>To understand how drug and alcohol abuse shows up in our community, we have to look at what causes it in the
        first place. It’s never just one thing. It’s a mix of pressure, pain, environment, biology, and even silence.
        When we talk about causes, we’re not just pointing fingers, we’re trying to understand why so many students turn
        to substances in the first place, and what needs to change to stop it from happening.</p>

      <p>One major cause is stress and mental health struggles. High school comes with a lot, academic pressure, social
        expectations, family problems, identity questions, and the pressure to plan a future while still figuring out
        who you are. For some students, the stress feels endless. And when you’re under constant pressure, your brain
        looks for relief. That’s when substances come into the picture. Alcohol, vaping, weed, pills, they all offer a
        quick escape. They make the stress feel like it’s gone, even if it’s just for a little while. But that escape
        has a cost, and for many students, it turns into a habit that’s hard to break.</p>

      <p>In class, we learned how the brain develops during the teenage years. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the
        brain that helps with judgment, impulse control, and long-term planning, is still developing. That means
        teenagers are more likely to take risks and less likely to fully understand the consequences of their choices.
        Combine that with emotional highs and lows, and substances can start to feel like the easiest way to cope. It’s
        not weakness, it’s neuroscience. That’s why awareness and education are so important, because when you
        understand what’s happening in your own brain, you can take control instead of losing it.</p>

      <p>Another cause is peer pressure and social norms. We all want to fit in. We all want to feel like we belong
        somewhere. And when the people around you are drinking, vaping, or using drugs, it gets harder to say no. It’s
        not always direct pressure either. Sometimes it’s subtle, just being in the room, not wanting to be the only one
        who isn’t doing it, or hearing people joke about it like it’s no big deal. That silence, that pressure to be
        “cool” or “chill,” ends up pushing people into things they wouldn’t choose if they were alone. We talked about
        this in class when learning about conformity and social modeling. People mirror what’s around them, especially
        when they don’t want to feel left out. In high school, that effect is even stronger.</p>

      <p>Trauma and family issues also play a big role. Some students are dealing with things most people never see,
        abuse, loss, instability, or growing up in a home where drug or alcohol use is already present. In these cases,
        using substances becomes a learned behavior, a way of coping with pain, or something that was modeled for them
        from a young age. These aren’t just personal problems, they are community issues, and they often go unseen
        because students are taught to stay quiet about what happens at home. But silence keeps the cycle going. When
        young people grow up with trauma or neglect, their risk for addiction goes way up. Not because they’re broken,
        but because they never had a stable foundation to build from.</p>

      <p>We also have to talk about access and normalization. In Marin, substances are easier to get than people want to
        admit. Teens know who to ask. They know which stores don’t card. They’ve seen older siblings or even parents
        using substances casually, and it sends the message that it’s not that serious. When drug and alcohol use
        becomes normalized, whether in media, music, or our own communities, it lowers the perceived risk. This is
        something we learned about through the concept of perceived invincibility. A lot of teens think, “It won’t
        happen to me,” even when they know the risks. That mindset is dangerous, because addiction doesn’t always start
        with a decision, sometimes it starts with denial.</p>

      <p>Lastly, we cannot ignore systemic causes. Marin is known for being privileged, successful, and safe. But that
        privilege sometimes hides the reality. Because we live in a community that’s seen as “better off,” a lot of
        students are expected to be perfect, high grades, strong resumes, and competitive colleges. That pressure builds
        up, and some students use substances just to numb the weight of expectation. On the other hand, not every
        student in Marin has the same level of access to support or safety at home. When systems fail to meet students
        where they’re at, when schools don’t have enough counselors, when mental health care is expensive or
        unavailable, or when addiction education is vague and outdated, the issue grows quietly in the background.</p>

      <p>The causes of drug and alcohol abuse are layered. They’re social, emotional, biological, and structural. And
        unless we address all of them, the cycle will keep repeating itself. If we want to prevent addiction in our
        schools and communities, we have to understand where it starts. Only then can we begin to interrupt it, not with
        judgment, but with real solutions that meet people where they are.</p>
