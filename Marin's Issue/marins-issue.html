      <h1>Marin’s Issue</h1>
      <p>
        Drug and alcohol abuse refers to the repeated use of substances like alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, prescription pills, and even stronger drugs such as Xanax or fentanyl, in ways that harm the brain, body, and future. What makes this issue even more serious in high school is how early it begins. In Marin County, students are being introduced to substances as early as middle school, often without understanding the long-term risks...

        At this age, the teenage brain is still developing. The part of the brain that controls decision-making and impulse control, the prefrontal cortex, is not fully formed until your mid-twenties. That means teens are more likely to take risks, follow the crowd, and underestimate the consequences of their actions. Substances hijack that process...
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t about just getting “in trouble.” This is about what happens next. Students who use substances are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, memory problems, poor academic performance, and damaged relationships...
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s also important to understand that this issue doesn’t look the same for everyone. For some, it’s drinking on weekends. For others, it’s vaping between classes or popping pills to numb emotional pain...
      </p>
      <p>
        Social media plays a huge role in how this issue spreads. Platforms like Snapchat and Instagram often glamorize substance use, making it look fun, normal, or even trendy...
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the scariest parts is how accessible everything is. Vapes are sold through social media and passed around like pencils. Pills are stolen from home medicine cabinets...
      </p>
      <p>
        This issue also hides in plain sight. Students who are high-achieving, well-liked, or heavily involved in school activities can still be struggling...
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the long-term consequences are not just about health or school. Substance abuse during adolescence can seriously disrupt brain development, alter personality, and reduce future opportunities...
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not just a teenage phase. It is a mental health crisis hiding under the surface of high school life. And unless we confront it with honesty, support, and real solutions, it will continue to harm more students in silence.
