    <section class="effects-section">
      <p>Drug and alcohol abuse in high school does not just affect the person using. It creates ripples that spread
        through their academics, relationships, mental health, and future. When people talk about addiction, they often
        picture the extreme, but the truth is, most of the damage starts small and silently. It shows up in everyday
        life, in the little things, and before you know it, those effects begin to stack up.</p>

      <p>One of the first places substance use shows up is academic performance. It becomes harder to focus, to stay
        motivated, to keep up. Students who start drinking or using drugs often experience memory issues, poor time
        management, and missing assignments. That’s not because they suddenly stop caring, it’s because the brain itself
        changes. As we learned in class, substances like alcohol and marijuana affect the hippocampus, which is
        responsible for learning and memory. So when students use, especially consistently, they physically lose the
        ability to retain what they learn in class. Even missing just a few days of concentration can have long-term
        academic consequences. Students fall behind, grades drop, and stress increases, which can lead to even more use.
        It becomes a cycle.</p>

      <p>The mental health effects are even more serious. Many students start using substances because they feel
        anxious, stressed, sad, or overwhelmed. But instead of solving the issue, substances actually make it worse.
        Alcohol is a depressant, meaning it lowers serotonin levels and increases feelings of sadness or numbness. Drugs
        that give a high, like nicotine or THC, often leave students feeling worse during the comedown. Over time, this
        leads to increased anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. In class, we talked about how chronic
        substance use disrupts the brain’s dopamine system, so the things that used to bring natural joy, like sports,
        music, or friendships, no longer feel rewarding. This leaves students feeling hollow, and they often don’t know
        why.</p>

      <p>Another major effect is relationship damage. When someone starts using, they begin to change. They may lie to
        friends and family, hide what they’re doing, isolate themselves, or become emotionally distant. Trust breaks
        down quickly. Friendships start to fade. Family members begin to worry or get angry. The person struggling may
        not even realize how much they’ve changed until it’s too late. In class, we talked about how addiction can cause
        “denial-based behavior,” like minimizing the problem, shifting blame, or avoiding conversations. These defense
        mechanisms often push people away, even when they’re trying to help. And when relationships fall apart, the
        person using often feels more alone, which pushes them further into the addiction cycle.</p>

      <p>Then there’s physical health, which is often overlooked at first. Vaping damages lung tissue, especially in
        teenagers whose lungs are still developing. Alcohol can affect the liver, sleep cycles, and heart function.
        Pills, weed, and other drugs can affect appetite, body weight, energy levels, and immune function. Many students
        using substances report chronic fatigue, headaches, nausea, or unexplained mood swings. What may start as a
        “once in a while” thing can quietly wear down the body over time. And once the physical effects begin, the
        mental toll gets even worse.</p>

      <p>One of the most dangerous long-term effects is addiction itself. Not every student who tries something becomes
        addicted, but many do. In class, we learned that the earlier someone starts using, the higher the chance they
        develop dependency later in life. The brain builds tolerance, meaning the same amount of a substance no longer
        has the same effect. That leads to increased use, stronger substances, and more risk. Eventually, the person
        doesn’t use to feel good anymore, they use just to feel normal. That’s when quitting becomes incredibly
        difficult. Withdrawal symptoms like anxiety, depression, irritability, or even physical pain kick in, and most
        students don’t know how to get out of it alone.</p>

      <p>There are also legal and safety consequences. Getting caught with substances at school or outside of it can
        lead to suspension, expulsion, or even a criminal record. This can affect college applications, job
        opportunities, and future goals. Some students end up in unsafe situations while under the influence, like
        getting into a car with a drunk driver, having non-consensual encounters, or putting themselves in risky
        environments they wouldn’t normally be in. The truth is, most students don’t intend for these things to happen,
        but substances cloud judgment, and one bad decision can change everything.</p>

      <p>Finally, there is the effect on identity. Substances often blur the line between who someone was and who they
        become. Many students report feeling like they don’t recognize themselves anymore. They become disconnected from
        the things they used to care about, like sports, art, music, or their own goals. They begin to lose their sense
        of direction. And for high school students, who are still figuring out who they are, that kind of identity loss
        can be incredibly hard to recover from.</p>

      <p>The effects of substance abuse are real, even if they don’t always show on the outside. They can be silent,
        slow, and hidden. But they shape lives in ways that students don’t always realize until the damage has been
        done. This is why early education, open conversation, and support matter. The earlier we intervene, the more
        students we protect from those long-term consequences.</p>
