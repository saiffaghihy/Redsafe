      <p>This is a page that aims to have a fundraiser soon.</p>

      <p>RedSafe is about more than awareness. It's about action. One way we're working to make a real difference is through our fundraiser. We're raising money to support prevention, education, and recovery programs that help teens who are impacted by drug and alcohol abuse in Marin County.</p>

      <p>We want to start this fundraiser because we've seen how hard it can be to get education and awareness, before it becomes an issue. Too many students are left without the resources they need. The money we raise will go toward organizations that focus on youth addiction recovery, school-based education programs, and mental health support for teens.</p>

      <p>This campaign matters to us. We're doing this because we care about the people around us. We've seen the pressure, the silence, and the damage that substance abuse causes, and we don't think anyone should have to face that alone. We're students who believe that small steps can lead to real change, and this is one of those steps.</p>

      <p>If you donate, share the link, or just talk to someone about what we're doing, you're helping move the conversation forward. You're helping create safer schools, stronger support systems, and a culture that values health, honesty, and community.</p>

      <p>Thank you for being part of it. Every contribution counts.</p>
