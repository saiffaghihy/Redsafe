      <h2>Jimmy Centeno</h2>
      <p>Hey everyone! My name is Jimmy Centeno and I am a freshman at Redwood High School. I play both basketball and lacrosse and I love getting outdoors. I’ve lived in Marin for my whole life and the main reason in which I started this campaign was due to the fact that when High School rolled around, I was brutally awakened to the culture and consequences of drugs and alcohol. I was fortunate enough to have an older brother who navigated through this way before I even stepped foot into High School, and I am always thankful for the guidance he gave. I am now looking to give you all the same guidance in which he gave me, as I care deeply about the safety of my friends and future freshmen.</p>

      <h2>Saif Faghihy</h2>
      <p>Hey guys, my name is Saif Faghihy and I am a sophomore here at Redwood. I play soccer and take part in track and field, and love being involved in leadership, extracurricular, and other academic or athletic activities. I recently moved here from Dubai, where I grew up, and I was definitely hit with a shock when I first settled in. I picked up on a worrying norm as part of the culture, where kids our age are overly exposed to drugs and alcohol, both in and out of the school environment, which leads to the very common abuse within our own community. I decided that very first moment that regardless of how accepted that was, it had a negative effect, which I only further learned about in our Social Issues class, which motivates me to take initiative how and when I can in order to ensure the safety of everyone here at Redwood.</p>
