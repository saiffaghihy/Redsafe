      <h2>What We’ve Done So Far</h2>
      <p>This campaign didn’t just live in our heads—it lived in our actions. As part of the RedSafe movement, we’ve created a fully functional website that features a variety of tools, information, and personal experiences related to teen drug and alcohol abuse in Marin.</p>
      <p>We produced a podcast series, <strong>Redwood Recovery: Stories That Matter</strong>, where real voices shared their journeys, including interviews with recovering addicts, student reflections, and in-depth discussions about mental health and recovery culture.</p>
      <p>We distributed surveys through our homepage form to gather real-time student feedback and perceptions. These anonymous submissions helped us understand just how common substance exposure really is—and helped shape our message to meet the needs of our community.</p>
      <p>We also took initiative outside the web. Our team has prepared printed awareness materials, worked with teachers on classroom discussions, and even began planning on-campus events and fundraisers designed to support local addiction recovery resources.</p>
      <p>Every action we took was deliberate. Every step we made was built around three pillars: awareness, prevention, and support. This isn’t just a grade for us—it’s our community. And we’re proud to do our part in protecting it.</p>
