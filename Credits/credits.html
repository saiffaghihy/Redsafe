      <h2>Project Credits</h2>
      <p>This campaign was built entirely by students at Redwood High School as part of a changemaking initiative. Every word, page, and design choice was made with intention and care.</p>

      <ul class="credits-list">
        <li><strong>Website & Campaign Founders:</strong> Saif Faghihy, James Centeno</li>
        <li><strong>Project Advisors:</strong> Mr. Hirsch, Mr. Sullivan Friedman</li>
        <li><strong>Podcast Creation:</strong> Saif Faghihy (host), James Centeno (host), Anonymous Guest</li>
        <li><strong>Music by:</strong> Amari J (original rap performance)</li>
        <li><strong>Website Design & Development:</strong> Saif Faghihy</li>
        <li><strong>Peer Awareness Contributors:</strong> Redwood High School students in Community and Consciousness</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Mr. Hirsch:</strong> Mr. Hirsch is our teacher that motivated us to start this project. Not only by giving us the final to work on but really proving with TUPE how a difference can always be made. This project is something we therefore plan to further expand regardless of the final.</p>
      <p><strong>Mr. Sullivan Friedman:</strong> Thanks to Mr. Sullivan Friedman, all of this could come alive. We were able to use code in our favor to make a website suitable for this matter, one that represents a lot of our learning this year in a very special way.</p>

      <p>Thank you to everyone who supported us, shared their stories, and believed in our message. This campaign wouldn’t exist without you.</p>
