      <p>Unfiltered is our podcast series, created to bring raw, honest conversations about teen drug and alcohol abuse
        into the spotlight. Hosted by Saif Faghihy and Jimmy Centeno, this project was built out of a need to tell the
        stories that are often kept quiet. Stories from students, from survivors, and from people who have seen
        firsthand what substance abuse can do to individuals, families, and communities.</p>

      <p>Each episode gets into a different perspective. Some guests are current or recovering addicts, sharing what led
        them into substance use and what it took to start climbing out. Others are students who have grown up around it,
        parents who have lost control of the situation, or professionals who work every day to support those affected.
        Every voice is real, every story matters, and every conversation is unfiltered.</p>

      <p>This is not a show filled with statistics and scripted advice. It is a space where people speak freely, where
        listeners can connect to something human, and where the silence surrounding this issue begins to break.</p>

      <p>Alongside the podcast, we have also somewhat written an original song for Amari J, created to raise awareness
        through music and emotion. It ties into the themes of the series, reminding listeners that recovery, support,
        and hope are always within reach.</p>

      <p>Unfiltered is more than a podcast. It is a space to listen, reflect, and understand what too many people try to
        ignore. Whether you are struggling yourself, supporting a friend, or just want to know what this really looks
        like, we invite you to listen. No judgment, no filters, just truth.</p>
